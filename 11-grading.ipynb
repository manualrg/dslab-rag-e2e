Hopfield developed an associative memory model in the 1980s that allows networks to store and reconstruct patterns. Building on this, Hinton developed the Boltzmann machine, which uses statistical physics principles to recognize and classify data. These pioneering contributions are essential for today's machine learning technologies, enhancing applications from medical imaging to material science.\",\n",
